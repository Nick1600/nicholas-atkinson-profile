                    <p class="about__content">
                        I am currently working part time in retail, and studying web development with CodeCademy. I've been studying for about 7 months, and I am really enjoying it. It is really satisfying to find solutions for problems, and think through roadblocks logily. Super stoked to be working in the field in not too long hopefully.
                        <br>
                        A few of my hobbies include: mountain biking, skiing, hiking, computer games, and of course, coding! I have always had a bit of an interest in coding, but never did anything with that until a little while ago. I was thinking about what I was wanting to do as my career, so I decided to do one of CodeCademy's free courses, and loved it! I haven't really looked back since then.

                        <p>This was a really fun project as it was my first proper project bring Javascript into a front end application. I'm proud of some of the problem solving that went on with one, like generating a random rgb value.</p>

                        <p>This is a portfolio for my darling wife. She is an artist, and wants professional to display her art works for potential employers. It was really fun to work with her, and although this one is a work in progress, I am proud of some of the responsive elements. I am excited to add some functionality with Javascript.</p>
